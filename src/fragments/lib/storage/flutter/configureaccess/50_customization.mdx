## Customization

### Customize Object Key Path

As mentioned above, configuring an access level in storage upload options will cause your files to be uploaded with a _public/_ _protected/_ or _private/_ prefix.

If you would like your items to be stored with a different prefix, you can customize your key path by defining a prefix resolver:

```dart
// Define your own prefix resolver, that conforms to `StorageS3PrefixResolver`
class MyCustomPrefixResolver implements StorageS3PrefixResolver {
  @override
  Future<String> resolvePrefix({
    required StorageAccessLevel storageAccessLevel,
    String? identityId,
  }) async {
    switch (storageAccessLevel) {
      case StorageAccessLevel.guest:
        return 'myPublicPrefix/';
      case StorageAccessLevel.protected:
        return 'myProtectedPrefix/${identityId!}/';
      case StorageAccessLevel.private:
        return 'myPrivatePrefix/${identityId!}/';
    }
  }
}
```

Then configure the storage plugin with the resolver.

```dart
final storagePlugin = AmplifyStorageS3(prefixResolver: MyCustomPrefixResolver());
await Amplify.addPlugin(storagePlugin);
```

You will need to update your permissions to allow access to your custom prefix. Go to s3.console.aws.amazon.com then go to IAM -> Roles.

Choose the Role associated with your Amplify app labeled [AMPLIFY_APP_NAME]-[ENV]-unAuthRole or authRole (for signed in users).

Under permissions, modify the relevant policy to enable read, write and delete operation for all the objects under path _myPublicPrefix/_.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:GetObject", "s3:DeleteObject"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::your-s3-bucket/myPublicPrefix/*"],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
  ]
}
```

If you want to have custom _private_ path prefix like `myPrivatePrefix/`, you need to add permissions to the IAM policy of your authenticated users. For example, for the given IAM principal (default authenticated role for Amplify projects):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject", "s3:DeleteObject"],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-s3-bucket/myPrivatePrefix/${cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub}/*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Passthrough PrefixResolver

If you would like no prefix resolution logic, such as performing S3 requests at the root of the bucket, create a prefix resolver that returns an empty string:

```dart
class PassThroughPrefixResolver implements StorageS3PrefixResolver {
  @override
  Future<String> resolvePrefix({
    required StorageAccessLevel storageAccessLevel,
    String? identityId,
  }) async {
    return '';
  }
}
```
